# Kure-Polynomial-Graphing-Engine
This Project is written in Java using Graphics2D as a rendering tool, but is interfaced with through a command line. 
The program allows for graphing of all polynomial functions, and viewing of said graphs.
This program graphs rational functions up to a degree 4 denominator.

## Graphs perform the following:
* Draw and denote Zeroes of the equation
* Draw and denote equations of linear asymptotes
* Stretched vertically and horizontally.

## The built-in calculator can:
* Add and Subtract equations
* Divide and multiply equations
* Calculate Derivatives of equations
